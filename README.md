background.html
This is the login page. The username is fatima and the password is 123. If you enter the wrong password, you will not be moved to the to-do list html page. 

This html file was created using css, html and javascript. The styles of the buttons and textbox were created in a seperate css file. 

todolist.html
This file incorporates the styles, html and javascript in the same file. This is to show diversity in writing code. 

I tried to show my own creativity therefore the list and the login page is different from the one in the assessment.
